Controls: WASDQE to rotate,  R to reset,  C to return to the world,  Tab to toggle hints.

UIOKL to change view mode.  U = Forty Five deg,   I = Isometric,
O = Top Down,   K = Oblique Y,   L = Oblique Z

Not every view mode is meant to be good, it's just to showcase what the system can do.
In actual games, shadows, resizing, parallax, and other hints of depth could be added to make the world seem more 3D.
