# Mono Demos

These demos are written in [C#](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/index.html).
You must have the Mono version of Godot to run these.

Languages: All have [C#](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/index.html),
2.5D has some GDScript

Renderers: Dodge the Creeps is GLES 3, rest are GLES 2

# Note: Godot 3.2.3 or newer is required

While most of the demos work with any 3.2.x version, these demos require
at least Godot 3.2.3 since there are large C#-specific changes in 3.2.3.
