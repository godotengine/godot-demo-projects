# Godot demo projects

Each folder containing a `project.godot` file is a demo project meant to
be used with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), the open source
2D and 3D game engine.

## Godot versions

- The [`master`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects) branch is compatible with the latest stable Godot version (currently 3.3.x).
- If you are using an older version of Godot, use the appropriate branch for your Godot version:

  - [***`3.2`***](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/3.2)
    branch for Godot 3.2.x.
  - [`3.1`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/3.1)
    branch for Godot 3.1.x.
  - [`3.0`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/3.0)
    branch for Godot 3.0.x.
  - [`2.1`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/2.1)
    branch for Godot 2.1.x.

## Importing all demos

To import all demos at once in the project manager:

- Clone this repository or [download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/archive/3.2.zip).
  - If you've downloaded a ZIP archive, extract it somewhere.
- Open the Godot project manager and click the **Scan** button on the right.
- Choose the path to the folder containing all demos.
- All demos should now appear in the project manager.

## Try the demos in your browser

Most of the demos are exported to GitHub Pages. They can be viewed
[here](https://godotengine.github.io/godot-demo-projects/).

**Note:** The performance of Godot in a browser is lower than natively on
desktop. For the best performance, consider downloading the demos.
