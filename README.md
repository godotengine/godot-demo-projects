# Godot demo projects

2D and 3D game engine.

## Importing all demos

To import all demos at once in the project manager:

- Clone this repository or [download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/archive/master.zip).
  - If you've downloaded a ZIP archive, extract it somewhere.
- Open the Godot project manager and click the **Scan** button on the right.
- Choose the path to the folder containing all demos.
- All demos should now appear in the project manager.

## Try the demos in your browser

Most of the demos are exported to GitHub Pages. They can be viewed
[here](https://godotengine.github.io/godot-demo-projects/).

**Note:** The performance of Godot in a browser is lower than natively on
desktop. For the best performance, consider downloading the demos.
