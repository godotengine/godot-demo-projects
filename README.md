# Godot demo projects

Each folder containing a `project.godot` file is a demo project meant to
be used with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), the open source
2D and 3D game engine.

## Godot versions

- The [`master`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects) branch is compatible with Godot's `master` development branch (next 4.x release).
- The [`3.x`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/3.x) branch is compatible with Godot's `3.x` development branch (next 3.x release).
- The other branches are compatible with the matching stable versions of Godot.
  - [Click here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/branches) to see all branches.
  - For example, the [`2.1`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/2.1)
    branch is for demos compatible with Godot 2.1.x.

## Importing all demos

To import all demos at once in the project manager:

- Clone this repository or [download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/archive/master.zip).
  - If you've downloaded a ZIP archive, extract it somewhere.
- Open the Godot project manager and click the **Scan** button on the right.
- Choose the path to the folder containing all demos.
- All demos should now appear in the project manager.

## Try the demos in your browser

Most of the demos are exported to GitHub Pages. They can be viewed
[here](https://godotengine.github.io/godot-demo-projects/).

**Note:** The performance of Godot in a browser is lower than natively on
desktop. For the best performance, consider downloading the demos.
