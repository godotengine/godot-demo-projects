"process is also the same - use keys to fetch the appropriate translation."

"The main difference between PO files and CSV files is the way both of them store "
"the translated data in their files.  Have a look at "TranslationFiles/PO" folder "
"and "TranslationFiles/CSV" folder to see the files involved in translation."
