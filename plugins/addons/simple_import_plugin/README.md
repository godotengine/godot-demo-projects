# Material Import Plugin Demo

This plugin demo shows how a custom import system can
be added to the editor. In this case, it imports a material.
For more information, see this documentation article:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/plugins/editor/import_plugins.html

In the editor, try opening `test.mtxt`. Godot will recognize
it and import it as a material because of this plugin.
