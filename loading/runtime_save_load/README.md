# Run-time File Saving and Loading

This project showcases how to load and save various file types without going
through Godot's resource importing system.

This is useful to load/save images, sounds, 3D scenes and ZIP archives at
run-time such as user-generated content, without requiring users to generate a
PCK file through Godot.

Can be loaded and saved at run-time:

- Images (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- 3D scenes (glTF 2.0)
- ZIP archives
- Plain text files[^1]

Can be loaded at run-time:

- Images (TGA, BMP, SVG[^2])
- 3D scenes (FBX[^3])
- Audio (Ogg Vorbis, MP3, WAV)
- Fonts (TTF, OTF, WOFF, WOFF2, PFB, PFM, BMFont)

[^1]: Manipulating custom binary formats is possible using the FileAccess and
PackedByteArray classes, but this is not shown in this demo.

[^2]: It is possible to procedurally generate SVG as text and save it to a file
with `.svg` extension using the FileAccess class, but this is not shown in
this demo.

[^3]: There are known issues with runtime FBX loading, as mentioned in issue
[#96043](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/96043).

See the [Saving and Loading (Serialization)](/loading/serialization/) demo for
an example of saving/loading game progress.
