## How does it work?

It uses the `push_frame()` method on an [`AudioStreamGeneratorPlayback`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_audiostreamgeneratorplayback.html)
object, which is inside of an
[`AudioStreamPlayer`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_audiostreamplayer.html)
node, to generate audio frame-by-frame based on `pulse_hz`.
