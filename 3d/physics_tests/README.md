This demo contains a series of tests for the 3D
physics engine.

They can be used for different purposes:

- Functional tests to check for regressions and
  compare the behavior between physics engines
- Performance tests to evaluate and compare
  performance between physics engines

Language: GDScript

Renderer: Forward+
