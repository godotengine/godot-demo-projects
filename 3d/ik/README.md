# 3D Inverse Kinematics

This is an example of different Inverse Kinematic algorithms
implemented in Godot. It contains four scenes, showing
different ways they can be used.

Language: GDScript

Renderer: Forward+

## How does it work?

This demo shows how to implement IK using two different methods. One uses the
[`SkeletonIK`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_skeletonik.html)
node which is built into Godot. The other method is using a script
called FABRIK (inside of the SADE plugin) for inverse kinematics.
