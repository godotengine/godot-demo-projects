Example of how to make a fake wall using TileMap's
`_tile_data_runtime_update()` method. It shows how
to disable collisions per layer.

Language: GDScript

Renderer: Compatibility

Check out this demo on the asset library: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2713

## Note

The new TileMapLayer introduced in Godot 4.3 allows disabling collisions for a layer dynamically using a checkbox in the inspector.
For earlier Godot versions use the procedure described here.
