States are common in games. You can use the pattern to:

1. Separate each behavior and transitions between behaviors, thus make scripts shorter and easier to manage
2. Respect the Single Responsibility Principle. Each State object represents [b]one[/b] action
3. Improve your code's structure. Look at the scene tree and FileSystem tab: without looking at the code, you'll know what the Player can or cannot do.

You can read more about States in the excellent [url=http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html]Game Programming Patterns ebook[/url]."
